% conclusion goes here. 

In this work we have presented an innovative $4D$ formulation for solving time-dependent PDE problems. We combined this within an adaptive setting and with variable order discretizations to realize a powerful framework. Our choice of algorithms specifically targets modern architectures with deep-memory hierachies and high levels of parallelism. We demonstrated improved strong and weak scaling as a result of the $4D$ formulation that is able to utilize parallel resources more efficiently compared to the traditional $3D$+time approach, where time is treated sequentially. Additionally, we derived both {\it a priori}, as well as residual-based {\it a posteriori} error estimates for the linear time dependent heat diffusion equation, and numerically illustrated improved convergence behavior of the space-time solution approach. By developing sophisticated numerical methods backed by theoretical guarantees of improved convergence, as well as innovative mesh and matrix free algorithms to enable efficient mapping to modern architectures, we have demonstrated impressive scalability results on current supercomputers.
We believe our methods are a first step towards improving the scalability of PDE solvers to the next generation of supercomputers. 

% In the current work, we have shown the enhanced scaling for the coupled space-time compared with the time - stepping method. 

% Further, we would like to exploit the matrix free version to enhance the  scalabilty of the code. Also, we would like to exploit the adaptive refinement in coupled space time based on the \textit{aposteriori} error estimates based on \textit{kD} trees.
