\begin{abstract}
We present a $kD$ tree-based parallel strategy for solving with a {\it spacetime}-adaptive approach a general class of partial differential equations. This approach is primarily motivated by the necessity of designing computational methodologies that can scale to leverage the availability of very large computing clusters (exascale and beyond). For evolution problems, the standard approach of decomposing the spatial domain is a powerful paradigm of parallelization. However, for a fixed spatial discretization, the efficiency of purely spatial domain decomposition degrades substantially beyond a threshold -- usually tens of thousands of processors -- which makes this approach unsuitable on next-generation machines. To overcome this barrier, a natural approach is to consider the time domain as an additional dimension and simultaneously solve for blocks of time (spacetime), instead of the standard approach of sequential time-stepping. Spacetime discretization includes natural incorporation a posterior error, availability of the solution for the full-time history, ability to remove time-stepping constraints such as CFL. We present scalable algorithms to perform, matrix-free, mesh-free numerical computations on topological trees, and shows strong and weak scalability across  32K cores in \Titan.

  \caption{\label{fig:Overview} {\small (A) Conventional approaches to computationally solving evolution equations rely on marching sequentially in time. This limits parallel scalability to the spatial domain. In contrast, we present an approach for simultaneously solving for large blocks of spacetime. This approach not only exhibits good scalability, but also provides improved temporal convergence (proved via {\it a priori} estimates) as well as localized refinement in space and time based on  {\it a posteriori} error estimates. (B) Illustrative results in $2D~\texttt{space} + 1D ~\texttt{time}$ dimensions (i.e. 3D spacetime) for a rotating heat source problem. Notice that the mesh is refined in {\bf spacetime} only in regions of interest. This not only guarantees accurate solutions in space {\bf and} time, but is also substantially more efficient than the strategy of taking very small time steps  necessary to guarantee temporal accuracy in the sequential approach.}}
