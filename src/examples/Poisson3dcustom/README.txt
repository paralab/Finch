Basic instructions for compiling this generated code with dendro.
    1. Place this generated directory in the Dendro directory.
    
    2. Append the following line to the Dendro CMakeLists.txt file:
        add_subdirectory(Poisson3dcustom)

3. Remake Dendro as usual. For example, to build to the directory "build",
   enter the Dendro directory and do the following.
    a. If it doesn't exist, make the build directory: "mkdir build"
    b. "cd build"
    c. "ccmake .."
    d. "make"
    e. "cd Poisson3dcustom "

4. Run the executable with "./poisson3dcustom "
    
    *Note: The directory will have an upper case first letter. 
           The executable will match the name passed to generateFor().
